# useChain

`useChain` is used to orchestrate animation hooks in sequence with one another.
This is best used when you specifically want to orchestrate different types of
animation hook e.g. [`useSpring`](/docs/components/use-spring) & [`useTransition`](/docs/components/use-transition)
in sequence as opposed to multiple `useSpring` hooks where you _could_ either use
[`useSprings`](/docs/components/use-springs) or create an [async animation](/docs/advanced/async-animations).

## Usage

This will first run the `useSpring` hook and then the `useTransition` hook when the component has mounted and the `useSpring` has come to rest.

```jsx lines=1-2,6,8,13,15,21
import {
  useTransition,
  useSpring,
  useChain,
  animated,
  useSpringRef,
} from '@react-spring/web'

const data = ['hi', 'there!']

function MyComponent() {
  const springRef = useSpringRef()
  const springs = useSpring({
    ref: springRef,
    from: { size: '20%' },
    to: { size: '50%' },
  })

  const transRef = useSpringRef()
  const transitions = useTransition(data, {
    ref: transRef,
    from: { scale: 0 },
    enter: { scale: 1 },
    leave: { scale: 0 },
  })

  useChain([springRef, transRef])

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        height: springs.size,
        width: springs.size,
        background: 'blue',
      }}>
      {transitions((style, item) => (
        <animated.div
          style={{
            width: '120px',
            height: '120px',
            background: 'green',
            ...style,
          }}>
          {item}
        </animated.div>
      ))}
    </animated.div>
  )
}
```

## Timesteps Explained

Using the previous as an example we can see that the transition is ran _after_ the `useSpring`
hook has come to rest. This is the default behaviour of the `useChain` hook.

However, they may be some instances where you want to define how long before the next spring
is triggered. That's where timesteps come in.

Take this usage of `useChain`:

```jsx
useChain([springRef, transRef], [0, 1], 1000)
```

We've added two additional arguments to the hooks, the first is a number array of timesteps
(numbers must be in the range 0-1) that should model to the index of your `SpringRef`s and
the second is a the timeframe (defaulting to 1000ms).

The way to think about the timesteps & timeframe is that the timestep of the hooks,
multiplied by the timeframe is the delay you apply to your animations:

```jsx
const refs = [springRef, transRef]
const timesteps = [0, 1]
const timeframe = 1000

refs.forEach((ref, index) => {
  /**
   * for the first ref this would be 0 because 0 * 1000 = 0
   * for the second ref this would be 1000 because 1 * 1000 = 1000
   */
  const time = timesteps[index] * timeframe

  // the delay is then applied to the animation.
  ref.delay = time
})
```

So therefore _if_ you wanted your transition to come in after 400ms you could do this:

```tsx
useChain([springRef, transRef], [0, 0.4])
```

Note, we omitted the `timeframe` argument here because it has a default of `1000`.

## Reference

This hook does not have a configuration object or take additional props.

## Typescript

```tsx
function useChain(refs: ReadonlyArray<SpringRef>): void

function useChain(refs: ReadonlyArray<SpringRef>, timeSteps: number[]): void

function useChain(
  refs: ReadonlyArray<SpringRef>,
  timeSteps: number[],
  timeFrame: number
): void
```
