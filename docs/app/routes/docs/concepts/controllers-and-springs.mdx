# Controllers & Springs

:::note
This is an advanced guide into the workings of react-spring with some prerequisites
of your own knowledge. You should be confident with [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) before reading this.
:::

## What you know

If you've already used the `useSpring` hook then you'll be familiar with the following code:

```tsx
const [styles, api] = useSpring(() => ({
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  backgroundColor: '#ff0000',
  scale: [1, 1, 1],
  config: {
    precision: 0.0001,
  },
}))
```

If we look only at the return value from our hook we can see it's an array with two items `styles` and `api`.
We'll initially focus on what `styles` are. This is an `object` of `SpringValue`s where the key of said `object`
correlates to the animatable keys referenced in the config object you passed (either in the way above or as part
of the `from` config object). The value of said key is a [`SpringValue`](#spring-value).

Explained in `typescript` terms the signature looks like:

```ts
type SpringValues<SpringConfig extends Record<string, any>> = {
  [Key in keyof OnlyAnimatableKeys<SpringConfig>]: SpringValue
}
```

In the example above, `OnlyAnimatableKeys` would narrow `SpringConfig` to only include the keys `x, y, backgroundColor, scale`.
Then because we know they're animatable, they will therefore be `SpringValue`s _note_ this is a simplified version of the types
in the library.

The second item in the array, `api` is a `SpringRef` which is an abstraction around the methods of the [`Controller`](#controller) class.
However, a `SpringRef` can manage multiple `Controller`s. For more information, see [`Imperative Api`](/docs/concepts/imperative-api).

## Controller

So where does the `Controller` come into all this? Well, every "spring" is infact, a `Controller`. Therefore, when you use the
hook `useSpring` you initialise a new `Controller` class and when you pass the number X to the `useSprings` hook, you're creating
X amount of `Controller`s.

These `Controller`s manage the `SpringValue`s you create in your config object. It's methods are very similar to that of the
[`SpringValue` class](/docs/advanced/spring-value), the primary methods used such as `start`, `stop`, `pause` run through the
array of managed SpringValues and call the exact same method:

```ts
// The set method from the Controller class
set(values) {
  for (const key in values) {
    const value = values[key]
    if (!is.und(value)) {
      this.springs[key].set(value)
    }
  }
}

// Would be used like this
controller.set({
  x: 0,
  scale: [0,0,0]
})
```

The signature of `useSpring` hook's config object is identical to the `Controller` class constructor first argument. You can
therefore draw the conclusion that the `useSpring` hook handles the lifecycle of the `Controller` class in the react environment
and adds the controllers to a provided (or generated in the hook) `SpringRef`, providing a very straight forward and clear
interface for managing one or more `Controller` classes. Meaning, if you so choose, you could omit using a hook and instead
use `Controller` class directly!

For a more detailed API description, see the [advanced api reference](/docs/advanced/controller) entry for Controller.

## Spring value

SpringValues are what you normally interact with, they're the props that are specifically passed to the `animated` component,
they can be interpolated and don't necessarily need to be named after properties of the element they're being used on:

```ts
const {
  backgroundColor, // SpringValue<string>
  o, // SpringValue<number>
  trans, // SpringValue<number[]>
} = useSpring({
  backgroundColor: '#00ff00',
  o: 0,
  trans: [0, 1, 2],
})
```

This is because the names you give are just the keys used in the `Controller` and the `SpringValue` only cares about the type of
value you're passing. Inside the `SpringValue` class we have the entire lifecycle of the animation, from the [event handlers](/docs/advanced/events)
being called to the type of advancement being used (e.g. `spring physics` or `duration`) the `SpringValue` is the driving force
for your animation.

In addition to controlling a "Fluid value" â€“ a value that changes over time (see [Fluids](#fluids) for more information). `SpringValues`
also apply their updates to the `animated node` they're passed to. You might recall if you had read the [animated elements](/docs/concepts/animated-elements)
concept page that on creation of the `animated` component, we convert any `SpringValues` into `AnimatedValues` which seems like a one way direction,
infact we attach this `AnimatedValue` to the original `SpringValue`, which allows the spring to update the animated node (e.g. `<animated.p>`.)
via the animated value when the `advance` function is called on the `SpringValue` via our `rafz` package. `SpringValue` is able to do this
because it extends the `FrameValue` which is a kind of `FluidValue`.

```ts
// Taken from `@react-spring/core/src/SpringValue.ts
class SpringValue<T = any> extends FrameValue<T>

// Taken from `@react-spring/core/src/FrameValue.ts
abstract class FrameValue<T = any> extends FluidValue<
  T,
  FrameValue.Event<T>
>

// Taken from `@react-spring/shared/src/FluidValue.ts`
abstract class FluidValue<T = any, E extends FluidEvent<T> = any>
```

Similar to the `Controller` class because it does not rely on react internals (this is how we animate outside the react render system) you can
use this class directly, however the lifecycle events that are associated with Controllers & hooks will not be applied and is something you
would need to manage yourself. For a more detailed API description of `SpringValue`, see the [advanced api reference](/docs/advanced/spring-value)
entry for `SpringValue`.

## Frame value

The first thing you'll notice about the `FrameValue` class is that is considered "abstract", this is a feature unique `typescript` and means that
you cannot instantiate the class directly. The point of an abstract class is to provide a base class that other classes can extend from in their shape
(methods / properties) but usually require some additional implementation. In the case of `FrameValue` we have the `advance` method which is abstract,
the `SpringValue` class extends `FrameValue` and implements it's own `advance` method. You can read more about abstract classes [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#abstract-classes-and-members).

## Fluids

Fluids is a small glue layer for observable events. It allows parent nodes send events to their children creating an event-driven system. Therefore,
when a `FluidObserver` has an event observered, it can perform an action. In the case of `SpringValue`, the `_start` function is called, thus animating
the `SpringValue`'s value, which in turn animates the `animated` node you're passing this value too.

Fluids are used all over this library, in the case of our `animated` HOC, we use Fluids to schedule animated updates with our `rafz` package.

If you want to learn more about Fluids, I recommend looking at our [source code!](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/blob/main/packages/shared/src/fluids.ts)

## What you learnt

You've probably learnt _alot_ about how the internals of `react-spring` works! But more importantly, you've specifically learnt about these things:

- How the `useSpring` hook works under the hood
- What is a `Controller` & `SpringValue`
- How we have an event-driven system embeded in the library!
