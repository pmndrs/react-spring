# Overview

Welcome to the `react-spring` (beta) docs site!

import { NAV_TILES } from '~/data/fixtures'
import { NavigationGrid } from '~/components/Grids/NavigationGrid'

<NavigationGrid cols={2} tiles={NAV_TILES} />

## What is this?

Our current documentation is lacking in features & clarity. So, based on
community feedback, we've made an endeavor to improve our documentation with a
few key differences:

- We want to explain more of our codebase conceptually e.g what is an `animated`
  component
- All our content will be searchable so no more running around in the dark
- Step-by-step tutorials on how to achieve common use-cases

## Please note

This site is a work in progress, it's slowly having its content added, there
are still a few requested features that are yet to be implemented, so there may
be bugs, and there may be spelling mistakes. Feel free to submit a PR to resolve
these issues if you'd like!

## How can I help?

Thank you for being interested in helping! It means a lot, if you want to provide
feedback please do so <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/discussions/1931">here</a>.
