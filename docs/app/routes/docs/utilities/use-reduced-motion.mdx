# useReducedMotion

A utility hook designed to stop the running of animations in `react-spring` through
determining whether a user prefers reduced motion.

## Usage

To get the most out of this hook, I recommend that you call it in the `root` of your app.
However, you may need to directly know the preference to synchronize a third-party system e.g.
autoplaying a video.

```tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from '@react-spring/web'

export default function MyApp() {
  const reducedMotion = useReducedMotion()

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      {reducedMotion ? <p>You're using reduced motion!</p> : null}
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Stopping animations

So how does this hook have the ability to stop all animations? `react-spring` has a `Globals` object,
these global objects are used for to synchronize hooks across your application. One property that can
be set is called `skipAnimation`. This property is a boolean and is checked by either the `Controller`
or `SpringValue` to see if it should animate. If `skipAnimation` is set to `true` then the animation
will "jump" to the goal value, similar to if the immediate prop is `true`.

The animation below has it's `skipAnimation` set to `true` so it will instantly jump to the goal value,
check the code to learn more.

```jsx live=true
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useSpring, animated, Globals } from '@react-spring/web'

export default function MyApp() {
  const isRight = useRef(false)

  const [springs, api] = useSpring(
    () => ({
      x: 0,
    }),
    []
  )

  const handleClick = () => {
    api.start({
      x: isRight.current ? 0 : 200,
      onRest: () => {
        isRight.current = !isRight.current
      },
    })
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    Globals.assign({
      skipAnimation: true,
    })

    return () => {
      Globals.assign({
        skipAnimation: false,
      })
    }
  })

  return (
    <animated.div onClick={handleClick} className="spring-box" style={springs}>
      Click me!
    </animated.div>
  )
}
```

## Why is it important?

Vestibular dysfunction, a balance disorder of the inner ear, is surprisingly common
among US adults. A study from the early 2000's found that approximately 69 million
Americans had vestibular dysfunction which results in vertigo, nausea, migraines and
hearing loss. Many people affected by vestibular dysfunction will choose to set the
"Reduce motion" setting in their operating system.

## Typescript

```ts
function useReducedMotion(): boolean
```
