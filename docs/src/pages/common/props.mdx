# Props

## Overview

```jsx
useSpring({ from: { ... }, to: { ... }, delay: 100, onRest: () => ... })
```

All primitives inherit the following properties (though some of them may bring their own additionally):

| Property          | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| from              | obj               | Base values, optional                                                                                                                                                    |
| to                | obj/fn/array(obj) | Animates to ...                                                                                                                                                          |
| loop              | obj/fn/bool       | Looping settings, see [loop prop](#loop-prop) for more details                                                                                                           |
| delay             | number/fn         | Delay in ms before the animation starts. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => delay                                                                      |
| immediate         | bool/fn           | Prevents animation if true. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => immediate                                                                               |
| [config](configs) | obj/fn            | Spring config (contains mass, tension, friction, etc). Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => config                                                       |
| reset             | bool              | The spring starts to animate from scratch (from -> to) if set true                                                                                                       |
| reverse           | bool              | "from" and "to" are switched if set true, this will only make sense in combination with the "reset" flag                                                                 |
| cancel            | bool/string/fn    | When `true`, the `cancel` prop stops the animation of every animated value owned by the `Controller` that receives it. See [cancel prop](#cancel-prop) for more details |
| pause             | bool              | The `pause` prop literally freezes animations in time.                                                                                                                   |
| `events`          | fn                | A variety of event callbacks (see [events](#events) for more information)                                                                                                |

## Advanced Props

### Loop Prop

Use `loop: true` to repeat an animation.

```js render=true edit=true
function LoopTrue() {
  const styles = useSpring({
    loop: true,
    from: { rotateZ: 0 },
    to: { rotateZ: 180 },
  })

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        height: 80,
        backgroundColor: '#46e891',
        borderRadius: 16,
        ...styles,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### The `loop` function

Pass a function to be called after each loop. Return `true` to continue
looping, or `false` to stop.

```js render=true edit=true
function LoopFunction() {
  const n = useRef(0)
  const styles = useSpring({
    loop: () => 3 > n.current++,
    from: { x: 0 },
    to: { x: 100 },
  })

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        height: 80,
        backgroundColor: '#46e891',
        borderRadius: 16,
        ...styles,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

The `loop` function can also return a `loop` object, which is described in the
next section. This is useful when you want to decide the next loop animation
right after the previous loop is finished.

### The `loop` object

Define a `loop` object to customize the loop animation separately from the
initial animation. It may contain any of the `useSpring` props. For example,
if `reverse: true` is used, the loop animation will reverse on each loop.

```js render=true edit=true
function LoopObject() {
  const styles = useSpring({
    loop: { reverse: true },
    from: { x: 0 },
    to: { x: 100 },
  })

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        height: 80,
        backgroundColor: '#46e891',
        borderRadius: 16,
        ...styles,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Inherited props

The `loop` object is always merged into a copy of the props object it was
defined in. The following example shows a loop animation that inherits its
`config` prop.

```js render=true edit=true
function InheritedProps() {
  const n = useRef(0)
  const styles = useSpring({
    from: { x: 0 },
    config: { duration: 1000 },
    loop: {
      x: 100,
    },
  })

  return (
    <animated.div
      style={{
        width: 80,
        height: 80,
        backgroundColor: '#46e891',
        borderRadius: 16,
        ...styles,
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

⚠️ Notice how the loop doesn't run more than once. That's because some props
are **never** inherited. These props include `default`, `reset`, and `reverse`.

**To loop the animation,** try adding `reset: true` to the `loop` prop in the above
example. Alternatively, you could add `from: { x: 0 }` to get the same effect.

Lastly, try adding `config: { friction: 5 }` to the `loop` object. This overrides
the inherited `config.duration` with a springy animation.

### Cancel Prop

When `true`, the `cancel` prop stops the animation of every animated value
owned by the `Controller` that receives it.

The following example never animates, because `cancel` is always true.

```js
useSpring({
  cancel: true,
  from: { x: 0 },
  to: { x: 100 },
})
```

Once the `cancel` prop turns from `true` to `false`, the declared animation
will resume or reset, depending on the given props.

#### Delayed updates

The `cancel` prop even prevents delayed updates. 😎

```jsx
const [style, animate] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0 }))

// Pass this to an element.
const onClick = () => {
  animate({ x: 100, delay: 500 })

  // Prevent the previous update. 🤣
  animate({ cancel: true })
}
```

#### Specific keys

To cancel the animation of specific keys, you can pass a single key, an array of
keys, or a `(key: string) => boolean` function.

```js
// Using a single key
cancel: 'x',

// Using an array of keys
cancel: ['x', 'y'],

// Using a function
cancel: key => key !== 'x',
```

The `reset` and `immediate` props support these same types.

### Events

| Event name | Description                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| onStart    | Callback when a spring or key is about to be animated    |
| onChange   | Frame by frame callback                                  |
| onRest     | Callback when a spring or key comes to a stand-still     |
| onPause    | Callback when a spring or key is paused                  |
| onResume   | Callback when a spring or key is resumed                 |
| onDelayEnd | Callback when a spring or key has finished being delayed |
| onProps    | Callback when a spring or key's props have been updated  |

#### Events as functions

Events excluding `onDelayEnd` and `onProps` all have the same arguments passed to them:

```jsx
(result: AnimationResult, spring: Controller | SpringValue, item?: Item) => void
```

So lets break this down:

- `result` (1st arg) – is an [Animation Result](#animation-results), this is an object containing the values of your spring at time of calling.
- `spring` (2nd arg) – is either the `Controller` or `SpringValue` of the Animation Result, this called the event
- `item` (3rd arg) – this is only available when using the [useTransition](/hooks/use-transition) hook or [Transition](/render-props/transition) component.

> ⚠️ **warning** ⚠️ – Currently `onStart` is called after the first animation tick, this value is considered _dirty_

`onDelayEnd` & `onProps` have the following arguments passed:

```jsx
(props: SpringProps, spring: SpringValue) => void
```

- `props` (1st arg) – the props object of the spring (all merged from the new values just passed).
- `spring` (2nd arg) – the affected `SpringValue` object

#### Events as objects

Events like can also be defined on a per-key basis.

```jsx
useSpring({
  from: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  onRest: {
    x: () => console.log('x.onRest'),
    y: () => console.log('y.onRest'),
  },
})
```

#### Animation result

Some events receive an `AnimationResult` object as their first argument when called. It contains the following properties:

- `value: any` The current value when the animation ended.
- `finished?: boolean` Equals true when the animation finished before being stopped or cancelled.
- `cancelled?: boolean` Equals true when the animation was cancelled.

The promise returned by the ref API's `start` method is resolved with an `AnimationResult` object, as well as the `start` method of the `SpringValue`
and `Controller` classes.

## Default props

The `default` prop lets you set the default value of certain props defined in
the same update.

### Declarative updates

For the declarative API, this prop is `true` by default. In the following
example, the `onRest` handler is inherited by every update passed to `animate`,
except when a call has its own `onRest` prop defined.

```jsx
useSpring({
  to: async animate => { ... },
  onRest: () => { ... }
})
```

### Imperative updates

Imperative updates can use `default: true` to set default props. When an
async `to` prop is defined by an imperative update, it will inherit props from
the imperative update like this:

```jsx
useSpring({
  from: { x: 0 },
  to: async animate => {
    // The `config` prop below is inherited by
    // both objects in the `to` array.
    await animate({
      to: [{ x: 100 }, { x: 0 }],
      config: { tension: 100 },
    })
  },
})
```

Default props are inherited while an update is being processed by the internal
diffing algorithm within the `SpringValue#_merge` [method][merge1].

[merge1]: https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring/blob/09f9a8aa34e73321d701c815b643576affd82a1c/packages/core/src/SpringValue.ts#L562-L824

For example, both the `ref` prop and the `animate` function will inherit
the default props defined below (in the `useSpring` props function).

```jsx
const ref = useSpringRef()
const [{ x }, api] = useSpring(() => ({
  x: 0,
  onRest: () => { ... },
  ref,
}))

useEffect(async () => {
  // Animate to 100 with the ref API.
  await ref.current.start({ x: 100 })
  // Animate to 0 with the returned API.
  await api.start({ x: 0 })
}, [])
```

### Compatible props

In the last example, only the `onRest` prop is inherited, because only some
props can have a default value.

The following props can have default values:

- `cancel`
- `config`
- `immediate`
- `onChange`
- `onDelayEnd`
- `onProps`
- `onRest`
- `onStart`
- `pause`

### The `default` object

In addition to passing `default: true`, you can also pass an object instead.
Only the props defined in your `default` object will be saved for future updates.

In this example, we are setting `true` as the default value of `immediate`. This
affects all future animations owned by the `useSpring` call, whether or not they
are declarative or imperative.

```js
const { x } = useSpring({
  x: 0,
  default: { immediate: true },
})
useEffect(() => {
  // This will be immediate.
  x.start(100)
})
```
