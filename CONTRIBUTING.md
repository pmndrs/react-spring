## Guidelines

Be sure your commit messages follow this specification: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/

### Duplicate `react` errors

React 16.8+ has global state to support its "hooks" feature, so you need to ensure only one copy of `react` exists in your program. Otherwise, you'll most likely see [this error](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html). Please try the following solutions, and let us know if it still doesn't work for you.

- **For `create-react-app` users:** Follow this guide: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991#issuecomment-496383268

- **For `webpack` users:** Add an alias to `webpack.config.js` like this:

  ```js
  alias: {
    react: path.resolve('node_modules/react'),
  }
  ```

- **For `gatsby` users:** Install `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports` and add this to your `gatsby-config.js` module:
  ```js
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports`,
    options: {
      alias: {
        react: path.resolve('node_modules/react'),
      },
    },
  },
  ```
