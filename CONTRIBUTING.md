### Windows permission errors

Some Windows users may need to [enable developer mode](https://howtogeek.com/292914/what-is-developer-mode-in-windows-10) if experiencing `EPERM: operation not permitted, symlink` with Preconstruct. If this persists, you might be running on an unsupported drive/format. In which case, consider using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows).
